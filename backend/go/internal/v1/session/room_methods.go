// Package session - room_methods.go
//
// This file contains the core state manipulation methods for the Room struct.
// These methods directly modify room state and are NOT thread-safe by design.
// They should only be called when the room's mutex lock is already held by the caller.
//
// The methods are organized by functionality:
//   - Client role management (add/delete participants, hosts, waiting users)
//   - Screen sharing management
//   - Chat history management
//   - Hand raising management
//   - Client disconnection cleanup
//   - Room state queries
//
// Thread Safety Note:
// All methods in this file assume the caller holds the room's RWMutex lock.
// This design centralizes locking logic in the router and broadcast methods,
// preventing deadlocks and ensuring consistent state updates.

// them in the client draw order queue for UI positioning.
//
// The client is added to the back of the draw order queue, meaning they appear
// at the end of the participant list initially.
//
// Thread Safety: This method is NOT thread-safe and must only be called when
// the room's mutex lock is already held.
//
// Parameters:
//   - client: The client to promote to participant status

// This method removes the client from the participants map and the client draw order queue.
// The client's draw order element reference is cleared to prevent memory leaks.
//
// Thread Safety: This method is NOT thread-safe and must only be called when

// addHost promotes a client to host status, granting them administrative privileges.
// This method updates the client's role, adds them to the hosts map, and places
// them in the client draw order queue. Hosts typically appear prominently in the UI.
//
// Host privileges include:
//   - Accepting/denying waiting room requests
//   - Managing screen sharing permissions
//   - Administrative control over the room
//
// Thread Safety: This method is NOT thread-safe and must only be called when

// them at the front of the waiting draw order stack (LIFO - Last In, First Out).
//
// The waiting room acts as a holding area where hosts can review and approve
// new participants before they join the main meeting.
//
// Thread Safety: This method is NOT thread-safe and must only be called when

// This is typically called when:
//   - A host accepts the waiting client (before promoting them)
//   - A host denies the waiting client
//   - The waiting client disconnects
//
// Thread Safety: This method is NOT thread-safe and must only be called when

// addScreenshare grants a client screen sharing privileges and updates their role.
// This method adds the client to the screen sharing map and the client draw order queue.
// Clients with screen sharing privileges typically have their video prominently displayed.
//
// Screen sharing permissions are usually granted by hosts and may be limited
// to one or a small number of concurrent screen sharers.
//
// Thread Safety: This method is NOT thread-safe and must only be called when

// addChat adds a new chat message to the room's chat history.
// This method appends the message to the end of the chat history list and
// enforces the maximum chat history length by removing older messages if necessary.
//
// Chat messages are stored in chronological order with the newest messages
// at the end of the list. The chat history is implemented as a doubly-linked
// list for efficient insertion and deletion operations.
//
// Memory Management:
// If maxChatHistoryLength is set (> 0), older messages are automatically
// removed when the history exceeds the limit, preventing unbounded memory growth.
//
// Thread Safety: This method is NOT thread-safe and must only be called when
// the room's mutex lock is already held.

//
// Use Cases:
//   - Message moderation (removing inappropriate content)
//   - User-initiated message deletion
//   - Administrative cleanup
//
// Performance Note:
// This operation has O(n) time complexity as it must search through the entire
// chat history to find the target message. For very large chat histories,
// consider implementing indexing if frequent deletions are expected.
//
// Thread Safety: This method is NOT thread-safe and must only be called when
// the room's mutex lock is already held.

// getRecentChats retrieves the most recent chat messages from the room's history.
// This method converts the chat history linked list to a slice and returns

//
// Message Ordering:
// Messages are returned in chronological order (oldest first, newest last)
// to maintain conversation flow when displayed in the UI.
//
// Limit Behavior:
// Currently defaults to returning the last 50 messages. This limit helps
// control memory usage and network bandwidth when sending chat history
// to newly connected clients.
//
// Performance Characteristics:
// - Time complexity: O(n) where n is the total number of messages
// - Space complexity: O(min(n, limit)) for the returned slice
//
// Thread Safety: This method is NOT thread-safe and must only be called when
// the room's mutex lock is already held.
//
// Parameters:
//   - payload: Request payload (currently unused but reserved for future filtering)
//
// Returns:
//   - Slice of chat messages in chronological order

// disconnectClient performs comprehensive cleanup when a client leaves the room.
// This method removes the client from all possible room states to prevent
// memory leaks and ensure consistent room state after disconnection.
//
// Cleanup Operations:
//   - Removes from all role-based maps (hosts, participants, waiting)
//   - Removes from all state maps (raising hand, sharing screen, audio/video states)
//   - Cleans up draw order queue references
//   - Prevents dangling pointers and memory leaks
//
// Design Note:
// This method is designed to be safe to call multiple times for the same client.
// It will cleanly handle cases where the client isn't present in certain maps.
//
// Thread Safety: This method is NOT thread-safe and must only be called when
// the room's mutex lock is already held.
//
// Parameters:
//   - client: The client to completely remove from the room

// isRoomEmpty determines whether the room has any active participants.
// A room is considered empty if it has no hosts, participants, or screen sharers.
// Waiting users are NOT counted as they haven't been admitted to the main meeting.
//
// Use Cases:
//   - Triggering room cleanup when the last participant leaves
//   - Deciding whether to close/archive empty rooms
//   - Resource management and memory cleanup
//
// Business Logic:
// Waiting room users don't count toward room occupancy because they haven't
// been admitted to the actual meeting. This prevents rooms from staying
// active indefinitely due to unapproved waiting users.
//
// Thread Safety: This method is NOT thread-safe and must only be called when
// the room's mutex lock is already held.

// Returns:
//   - true if the room has no active participants (only waiting users or completely empty)
//   - false if there are any hosts, participants, or screen sharers

// raiseHand adds a participant to the hand-raising queue and updates their status.
// This method allows participants to request speaking time or attention from hosts.
// The participant is added to both the raising hand map and the hand draw order queue.
//
// Queue Behavior:
// Participants are added to the back of the hand raise queue (FIFO - First In, First Out).
// This ensures fair ordering when multiple participants want to speak.
//
// Validation:
// Only participants can raise their hands. The method searches the participants
// map to verify the client exists and has the appropriate role.
//
// UI Integration:
// The hand raise status is typically displayed in the UI with visual indicators
// and the queue order helps hosts manage speaking turns.
//
// Thread Safety: This method is NOT thread-safe and must only be called when
// the room's mutex lock is already held.
//
// Parameters:
//   - payload: Contains the ClientId of the participant raising their hand

// lowerHand removes a participant from the hand-raising queue and updates their status.
// This method allows participants to withdraw their request to speak or is called
// when a host acknowledges their raised hand.
//
// Cleanup Operations:
//   - Removes from the raising hand map
//   - Removes from the hand draw order queue
//   - Clears the draw order element reference to prevent memory leaks
//
// Queue Management:
// When a participant lowers their hand, they are removed from their current
// position in the queue, which may affect the ordering of other participants.
//
// Use Cases:
//   - Participant voluntarily lowers their hand
//   - Host acknowledges the participant (they can now speak)
//   - Administrative reset of hand-raising status
//
// Thread Safety: This method is NOT thread-safe and must only be called when
