## Documentation Philosophy

### Mirroring Backend Excellence

Just as your Go backend follows clean architecture principles:

```text
backend/go/
├── cmd/           # Entry points
├── internal/      # Core business logic
│   ├── api/       # HTTP handlers
│   └── v1/        # Domain logic
└── deploy/        # Infrastructure
```

Our frontend documentation follows similar organization:

```text
frontend/docs/
├── COMPONENT_ARCHITECTURE.md    # UI structure (like internal/api)
├── SHADCN_IMPLEMENTATION.md     # Implementation details (like cmd)
├── HOOKS_INTEGRATION.md         # Integration layer (like handlers)
├── TYPESCRIPT_INTERFACES.md     # Type contracts (like domain models)
└── HOOKS_GUIDE.md              # Business logic (like internal/v1)
```

### Design Principles

#### 1. **Separation of Concerns**

- **Components** handle presentation (like HTTP handlers)
- **Hooks** handle business logic (like domain services)
- **Types** define contracts (like domain models)
- **Integration** manages data flow (like use cases)

#### 2. **Progressive Disclosure**

- Start with **COMPONENT_ARCHITECTURE.md** for overview
- Move to **SHADCN_IMPLEMENTATION.md** for specifics
- Reference **TYPESCRIPT_INTERFACES.md** for types
- Use **HOOKS_INTEGRATION.md** for connections

#### 3. **Practical Examples**

- Every concept includes working code
- Real-world usage patterns
- Production-ready implementations
- Clear integration paths

## How to Use This Documentation

### For New Team Members

#### Week 1: Understanding the Architecture

1. Read **COMPONENT_ARCHITECTURE.md** - Understand UI organization
2. Review **HOOKS_GUIDE.md** - Learn business logic patterns
3. Scan **TYPESCRIPT_INTERFACES.md** - Familiarize with types

#### Week 2: Hands-On Implementation

1. Follow **SHADCN_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Build your first component
2. Use **HOOKS_INTEGRATION.md** - Connect hooks to UI
3. Reference **TYPESCRIPT_INTERFACES.md** - Ensure type safety

### For Feature Development

#### Planning Phase

- Review **COMPONENT_ARCHITECTURE.md** for UI patterns
- Check **TYPESCRIPT_INTERFACES.md** for existing types
- Plan integration using **HOOKS_INTEGRATION.md** patterns

#### Implementation Phase

- Use **SHADCN_IMPLEMENTATION.md** for component code
- Follow **HOOKS_INTEGRATION.md** for data flow
- Reference **TYPESCRIPT_INTERFACES.md** for type definitions

#### Testing Phase

- Verify patterns match **COMPONENT_ARCHITECTURE.md**
- Test integration points from **HOOKS_INTEGRATION.md**
- Validate types using **TYPESCRIPT_INTERFACES.md**

### For Code Reviews

#### Architecture Review

- Does it follow **COMPONENT_ARCHITECTURE.md** patterns?
- Are hooks properly integrated per **HOOKS_INTEGRATION.md**?
- Are types defined in **TYPESCRIPT_INTERFACES.md**?

#### Implementation Review

- Does code match **SHADCN_IMPLEMENTATION.md** standards?
- Are accessibility features implemented correctly?
- Is error handling following documented patterns?

## Quick Reference

### Common Tasks

#### Adding a New Component

1. Check **COMPONENT_ARCHITECTURE.md** for category
2. Use **SHADCN_IMPLEMENTATION.md** as template
3. Define types in **TYPESCRIPT_INTERFACES.md**
4. Integrate using **HOOKS_INTEGRATION.md** patterns

#### Connecting a Hook to UI

1. Review hook in **HOOKS_GUIDE.md**
2. Find integration pattern in **HOOKS_INTEGRATION.md**
3. Apply types from **TYPESCRIPT_INTERFACES.md**

#### Understanding Data Flow

1. Start with **HOOKS_INTEGRATION.md** examples
2. Trace through **COMPONENT_ARCHITECTURE.md** patterns
3. Validate with **TYPESCRIPT_INTERFACES.md** types
